    <h2 id="help5">Frequently Asked Questions <a href="#wrapper" class="top">Back to top</a></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Can I use this script on my client's website?</strong>
        <p>Yes. Your license includes the rights to use the script on any one website at a time. If you'd like to use the script as part of a service, please consider purchasing an Extended License.</p>
      </li>
      
      
      
      <li>
        <strong>Can I make modifications to this script?</strong>
        <p>Feel free to make any modifications you need. Also feel free to blog and show it to your friends, but please do not redistribute the script with your changes. </p>
      </li>
      
      
      
      
      <li>
        <strong>Why the plugin doesn't work?</strong>
        <p>Make sure you don't have multiple versions of jquery in your page. Look at the source view in your browser to see what javascript files you are loading.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;script src="crazy_path/<strong>jquery.js</strong>" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
...
&lt;script src="crazy_path/<strong>jquery.min.js</strong>" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
...
&lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4/<strong>jquery.min.js</strong>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
        <p><strong>jquery.js</strong> and <strong>jquery.min.js</strong> are the same script. Delete the last one if you can. Keep only one.</p>
        
        <p>Also, please check that there is a <code>wp_head();</code> template tag in your theme header.php and there is a <code>wp_footer();</code> template tag in your theme footer.php.</p>
        <p>Alternately you may have other plugins that conflict with Slider Evolution. Try disabling your other plugins and see if that helps. If it does, re-enable each plugin, one at a time to see which one is causing the conflict. Please let me know which plugin is causing the problem.</p>
      </li>



      <li>
        <strong>The slider is positioned incorrectly or behaving strangely in Internet Explorer</strong>
        <p>This is likely a doctype issue. This plugin requires a valid doctype and rendering in quirks mode is not supported.
         Make sure you are using the full doctype declaration to insure rendering in standards mode.</p>
         
         <p>This abbreviated doctype renders the document in quirks mode for Internet Explorer:</p>
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
</pre>
       <p>The doctype with URI renders in standards mode for all browsers:</p>
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;
</pre>
      </li>
      
      
    </ol>



    <h2 id="help7">Known Problems <a href="#wrapper" class="top">Back to top</a></h2>

      <li>
        <strong>No support for iPad</strong> (if someone wants to donate an iPad to me I'll guarantee support)
      </li>
